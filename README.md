# 💻✨ Postman - LIVE Project

🎯 This repository contains a collection of **real-world API testing scenarios** created and executed in **Postman**.  
The project demonstrates hands-on experience with **API testing, authentication mechanisms, schema validation, and automation workflows**.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **1. LocalServer Person** | CRUD operations against a locally hosted Person API server for testing REST endpoints. |
| **2. GitHub** | API requests interacting with GitHub’s REST API (repositories, users, etc.) using Personal Access Tokens. |
| **3. File Upload API** | Demonstrates multipart/form-data requests for file uploads and validation of server responses. |
| **4. JIRA - Basic Auth** | API automation using JIRA’s REST API with Basic Authentication for project and issue management. |
| **5. JSON Schema Validation** | Validates API responses against predefined JSON Schemas for contract testing. |
| **Authentication** | Collection of APIs demonstrating token-based authentication, login/logout workflows, and token refresh. |
| **Spotify Playlist (OAuth)** | OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to access Spotify APIs — create, modify, and retrieve playlists. |
